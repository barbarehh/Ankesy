# Ankesy 

*Learn From Mistakes*

Ankesy is a simple and effective Chrome extension prototype designed to help older adults recognize phishing scams and improve their media literacy. It works by creating safe, simulated phishing scenarios that teach users to learn from their mistakes and stay alert online.

## What Does Ankesy Do?  

- **Simulated Phishing Ads**  
  Displays realistic fake phishing ads like "Youâ€™ve won an iPhone!" designed to mimic scams commonly targeting older adults.  

- **Learn Safely**  
  Clicking these ads leads to a fake phishing site. If users share personal info, they see an educational message explaining what went wrong.  

- **Guardian Alerts**  
  Sends an email notification to a designated guardian if a phishing attempt is detected, helping provide additional support.  


## How to Use  

1. **Install the Prototype**  
   Add Ankesy to your Chrome browser.  

2. **Register**  
   Enter basic information during registration to set up your profile.  

3. **Simulate & Learn**  
   Ankesy will generate fake phishing ads as you browse the internet, allowing you to practice spotting scams safely.  



## Why Ankesy?  

Phishing scams often target older adults, because of their limited familiarity with online threats and digital safety. Ankesy provides a practical, hands-on learning experience that allows users to encounter and interact with simulated phishing attempts without any real-world consequences. With the slogan "Learn From Mistakes", Ankesy emphasizes learning through real practice, empowering users to build confidence and protect themselves from actual scams.
